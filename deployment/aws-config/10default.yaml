# aws-config is a directory
# containing all the YAML files that
# describe the configuration of
# a refinery-platform stack.

# All the .yaml files are used as configuration.

# This is the 00defauly.yaml file;
# it specifies defaults.
# Some of which might be overridden in later
# configuration files.

# If an entry says "FIXED to blah"
# then you can't change it,
# but it might become configurable later.
