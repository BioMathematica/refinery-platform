Analyses are implemented as Galaxy workflows and executed through the Galaxy API.\r\n\r\n### News\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* __12 January 2016__ | The [Gehlenborg Lab at Harvard Medical School](http://gehlenborglab.org) is looking for a [data visualization software developer](https://sjobs.brassring.com/tgwebhost/jobdetails.aspx?jobId=1191244&PartnerId=25240&SiteId=5341&type=mail&JobReqLang=1&recordstart=1&JobSiteId=5341&JobSiteInfo=1191244_5341&gqid=0) who will also be contributing to the Refinery Platform project. Our goal is to build groundbreaking open-source data visualization software that are employed in cutting-edge biomedical research and drive scientific progress. We are looking for a highly motivated and creative individual with a passion for code, data, design, and biomedical science.\r\n\r\n* __20 November 2015__ | We are thrilled to have been selected for an [AWS in Education Research Grant](http://aws.amazon.com/grants/) award to support the development of a cloud-based version of the Refinery Platform!\r\n\r\n* __2 September 2015__ | The Refinery Team welcomes Scott Ouellette (@scottx611x) who joins us as a Software Developer. Welcome Scott!\r\n\r\n* __10 July 2015__ | We are presenting a [poster](http://gehlenborg.com/wp-content/uploads/refinery_poster_biovis-2015.pdf) about our provenance visualization approach at the BioVis 2015 conference at ISMB/ECCB 2015 in Dublin, Ireland.\r\n\r\n* __18 May 2015__ | We are excited to welcome two new team members: Jennifer Marx (@jkmarx) and Fritz Lekschas (@flekschas). Welcome Jennifer and Fritz!\r\n\r\n* __5 January 2015__ | [The Refinery Team is hiring](https://jobs.brassring.com/tgwebhost/jobdetails.aspx?jobId=1118216&PartnerId=25240&SiteId=5341&type=mail&JobReqLang=1&recordstart=1&JobSiteId=5341&JobSiteInfo=1118216_5341&gqid=0)! As part of an initiative with the [Harvard Stem Cell Institute](http://hsci.harvard.edu), the Park Lab is looking for an experienced and enthusiastic software developer to participate in extending Refinery Platform for the [Harvard Stem Cell Commons](http://stemcellcommons.org). The software developer should be comfortable with and be experienced in working on both server-side components (including compute clusters and/or clouds) and client-side (web UI) components, as well as modern software engineering practices such as automated testing and continuous integration/deployment. Our ideal candidate has experience in full stack web software development with a focus on designing, developing and maintaining production software systems in data-intensive settings, ideally for scientific applications. The [detailed job ad](https://jobs.brassring.com/tgwebhost/jobdetails.aspx?jobId=1118216&PartnerId=25240&SiteId=5341&type=mail&JobReqLang=1&recordstart=1&JobSiteId=5341&JobSiteInfo=1118216_5341&gqid=0) is on the Harvard HR website.\r\n\r\n* __9 October 2014__ | We are thrilled that the [Mozilla Science Lab](http://mozillascience.org) has included the Refinery Platform project in the 1st round of their new [collaboration program](collaborate.mozillascience.org). If you are an open source developer interested in contributing to a scientific software project you can check out a list of tasks at [collaborate.mozillascience.org/projects/refinery](collaborate.mozillascience.org/projects/refinery).\r\n\r\n* __7 October 2014__ | Guess what? Refinery is now on Twitter: [@_refinery](http://twitter.com/_refinery). Follow us for project updates and other important announcements.\r\n\r\n* __29 June 2014__ | Ilya Sytchev (@hackdna) participated in the [Galaxy Community Conference Hackathon](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Events/GCC2014/Hackathon) and contributed code to the Galaxy project that will allow us to cancel analyses running in Galaxy directly from Refinery. He also presented a poster on our experience in interacting with the Galaxy API.\r\n\r\n* __8 June 2014__ | Jeremy Liu (@jeremyjliu) from Yale will spend the summer with the Refinery team as an intern through the [MIT HST and i2b2 Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) summer institute](http://hst.mit.edu/academics/summer-institute/bioinformatics). \r\n\r\n* __1 May 2014__ | Anton Xue (@AntonXue) from Boston Latin School joins the project as an intern. Welcome Anton!\r\n\r\n* __1 January 2014__ | The Refinery project will be receiving additional funding through an NIH/NHGRI Pathway Independence Award to Nils Gehlenborg (@ngehlenborg).\r\n\r\n* __10 December 2013__ | In collaboration with Stefan Luger (@sluger) and  Marc Streit (@mstreit) we have added a novel workflow visualization to Refinery that allows users to view and explore workflows imported into Refinery from a Galaxy instance.\r\n\r\n* __28 August 2013__ | Thanks to the efforts of Ilya Sytchev (@hackdna) from the Harvard School of Public Health team, we are now able to provide a _painless deployment strategy using Vagrant, Puppet and Virtualbox for developers_ and others who would like to test the system on their own machine. The setup is almost completely automated and details can be found in the [README](https://github.com/parklab/refinery-platform) in our GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Talks and Presentations\r\n\r\n* __Test__, _Test 2017_, Test, Testland, Test 2017.
