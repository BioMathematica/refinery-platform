{"name":"Refinery Platform","tagline":"","body":"### About \r\nThe Refinery Platform is a web-based data visualization and analysis system powered by an ISA-Tab-compatible data repository for public and private data sets. Analyses are implemented as Galaxy workflows and executed through the Galaxy API.\r\n\r\n### News\r\n\r\n* __1 January 2014__ | The Refinery project will be receiving additional funding through an NIH/NHGRI Pathway Independence Award to [Nils Gehlenborg](@ngehlenborg).\r\n\r\n* __10 December 2013__ | In collaboration with [Stefan Luger](@sluger) and [Marc Streit](@mstreit) we have added a novel workflow visualization to Refinery that allows users to view and explore workflows imported into Refinery from a Galaxy instance.\r\n\r\n* __28 August 2013__ | Thanks to the efforts of [Ilya Sytchev](@hackdna) from the Harvard School of Public Health team, we are now able to provide a _painless deployment strategy using Vagrant, Puppet and Virtualbox for developers_ and others who would like to test the system on their own machine. The setup is almost completely automated and details can be found in the [README](https://github.com/parklab/refinery-platform) in our GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n### Talks and Presentations\r\n\r\n* __Reproducible Analyses of Large and Complex Epigenomics and Genomics Data: A Foundation for Visual Exploration__, _Keystone Symposium on Big Data in Biology 2014_, San Francisco, USA, March 2014.

In repository mode workflows cannot be accessed (note that this is running an early version of Refinery).\r\n- http://www.stemcellcommons.org | The Refinery Platform will provide data manipulation, analysis and visualization capabilities for the Stem Cell Commons project (under development).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nOur documentation for Refinery Platform users, administrators and developers is available at http://refinery-platform.readthedocs.org. This is work in progress.\r\n\r\n### Project Team\r\nThe Refinery Platform is a project of the <a href=\"http://compbio.med.harvard.edu\">Park Lab</a> at Harvard Medical School in collaboration with the <a href=\"\">Hide Lab</a> at Harvard School of Public Health.\r\n\r\n#### Park Lab\r\n* Nils Gehlenborg (@ngehlenborg)\r\n* Richard Park (@rpark37)\r\n* Psalm Haseley (@psm3426)\r\n* Peter J Park\r\n\r\n#### Hide Lab\r\n* Ilya Sytchev (@hackdna)\r\n* Shannan Ho Sui (@sjhosui)\r\n* Winston Hide\r\n\r\n### External Collaborators\r\n\r\n#### Johannes Kepler University Linz (Austria)\r\n* Marc Streit (@mstreit)\r\n* Stefan Luger (@sluger)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Funding\r\nThe project is funded in part by an [NIH/NHGRI Pathway to Independence Award](http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8633263&icde=19462221) to Nils Gehlenborg, an [Agilent Technologies Emerging Insights Grant](https://www.chem.agilent.com/en-US/promotions/pages/grant2.aspx) to Peter Park and by the [Harvard Stem Cell Institute](http://www.hsci.harvard.edu/research/center-stem-cell-bioinformatics).\r\n\r\n### Contact and Support\r\nPlease create a ticket in the issue tracker or email us at refinery@hms.harvard.edu.","google":"UA-34358706-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
