In repository mode workflows cannot be accessed.\r\n- http://www.stemcellcommons.org | The Refinery Platform will provide data manipulation, analysis and visualization capabilities for the Stem Cell Commons project (under development).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nOur documentation for Refinery Platform users, administrators and developers is available at http://refinery-platform.readthedocs.org. This is work in progress.\r\n\r\n### Project Team\r\nThe Refinery Platform is a project of the <a href=\"http://compbio.med.harvard.edu\">Park Lab</a> at Harvard Medical School in collaboration with the <a href=\"\">Hide Lab</a> at Harvard School of Public Health.\r\n\r\n#### Park Lab\r\n* Nils Gehlenborg (@ngehlenborg)\r\n* Richard Park (@rpark37)\r\n* Psalm Haseley (@psm3426)\r\n* Peter J Park\r\n\r\n#### Hide Lab\r\n* Ilya Sytchev (@hackdna)\r\n* Shannan Ho Sui (@sjhosui)\r\n* Winston Hide\r\n\r\n### Funding\r\nThe project is funded in part by an [Agilent Technologies Emerging Insights Grant](https://www.chem.agilent.com/en-US/promotions/pages/grant2.aspx) to Peter Park.\r\n\r\n### Contact and Support\r\nPlease create a ticket in the issue tracker or email us at refinery@hms.harvard.edu.","google":"UA-34358706-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
